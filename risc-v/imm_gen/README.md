Here's a summary of the `imm_gen` module:

### Overview

The `imm_gen` (Immediate Generator) module is responsible for extracting and extending the immediate value from an instruction in a RISC-V processor. This immediate value is used in various operations such as arithmetic, memory access, and branch instructions.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization.
  - `rst`: Reset signal to initialize the module.
  - `inst[31:0]`: 32-bit instruction input from which the immediate value is extracted.

- **Outputs:**
  - `imm[31:0]`: 32-bit immediate value extracted and sign-extended from the instruction.

### Functionality

1. **Reset Behavior:**
   - When the `rst` signal is high (`1`), the module sets the immediate output (`imm`) to zero.

2. **Immediate Value Generation:**
   - The module uses a `case` statement to determine how to extract and extend the immediate value based on the opcode (the 7-bit value in the `inst` input).

   - **For `OP_I_TYPE` Instructions:**
     - Extracts a 12-bit immediate from bits `[31:20]` of the instruction and sign-extends it to 32 bits.

   - **For `OP_S_TYPE` Instructions:**
     - Combines bits `[31:25]` and `[11:7]` to form a 12-bit immediate, then sign-extends it to 32 bits.

   - **For `OP_B_TYPE` Instructions:**
     - Constructs a 12-bit immediate from specific bits in the instruction and sign-extends it to 32 bits.

   - **For `OP_U_TYPE` Instructions:**
     - Extracts bits `[31:12]` and appends 12 zeroes to form a 32-bit immediate.

   - **For `OP_J_TYPE` Instructions:**
     - Constructs a 20-bit immediate from specific bits in the instruction and sign-extends it to 32 bits.

   - **Default Case:**
     - If the opcode does not match any known type, it sets the immediate output to zero.

### Summary

The `imm_gen` module reads the opcode from an instruction, determines the type of instruction (I, S, B, U, or J), and generates the corresponding immediate value by extracting and extending the relevant bits from the instruction. This immediate value is then used by other parts of the processor to perform various operations.
