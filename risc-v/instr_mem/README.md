The Instruction Memory (IMEM) in a RISC-V processor is a simple memory block that stores the instructions to be executed. It generally has the following inputs and outputs:

### Inputs:
1. **Address (`addr`)**:
   - **Width**: Typically 32 bits.
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the memory address from which the instruction should be fetched. This is usually the current value of the program counter (PC).

2. **Clock (`clk`)**:
   - **Purpose**: The clock signal, which may be used if the IMEM is synchronous. This signal synchronizes the fetching of instructions with the processor's clock cycle.

3. **Reset (`rst`)** (optional):
   - **Purpose**: Resets the memory, often initializing the memory contents or resetting any internal state.

### Outputs:
1. **Instruction (`instr`)**:
   - **Width**: Typically 32 bits (the width of a RISC-V instruction).
   - **Purpose**: The instruction fetched from the memory at the specified address. This instruction will be passed to the instruction decode unit.

### Example of a Simple IMEM Module
The IMEM can be implemented as a simple read-only memory (ROM) or as an array of registers initialized with instruction values. In many cases, the IMEM is designed to be read-only and preloaded with instructions during simulation or synthesis.
